### RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS 
What biases did you expect to find in the data (before you started working with it), and why?

Before working with Wikipedia data, I expected biases because of the nature of Wikipedia's content generation. Wikipedia is created and edited by volunteers, and as such, biases may arise based on the interests, expertise, and perspectives of those contributors.
Sources of bias can include underrepresentation of certain topics or regions, systemic bias related to gender, ethnicity, and cultural perspectives, and uneven coverage of notable versus non-notable subjects.


What might your results suggest about (English) Wikipedia as a data source?

Wikipedia is a valuable but imperfect data source. Its reliability and completeness can vary significantly across topics. The biases observed may limit its suitability for some research questions or applications.

What (potential) sources of bias did you discover in the course of your data processing and analysis?

I discovered during my analysis that some of the regions were covered more as compared to the other regions
